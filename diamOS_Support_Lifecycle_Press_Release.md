# Understanding diamOS Support Lifecycle

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**  
**November 4, 2024**

**Keighley, Bradford –** diam Systems is committed to providing its customers with a clear and dependable support strategy for diamOS. We build diamOS upon the robust foundation of Ubuntu Long-Term Support (LTS) releases, ensuring a stable and reliable core for our users. However, it is important for our customers to understand the distinctions between Ubuntu’s support timeline and our own.

## diamOS and Ubuntu LTS: Two Support Cycles

Each major release of diamOS aligns with an Ubuntu LTS base, which has a guaranteed five-year support period from Canonical, the developers of Ubuntu. For example, diamOS 1, released in July 2024, is based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and will continue to receive Ubuntu support until April 2027. Despite this extended Ubuntu timeline, diam Systems typically supports each major version of diamOS for a shorter period, approximately 2-3 years after its release. In this case, diamOS 1 will likely reach the end of its supported lifecycle from diam Systems around July 2026.

This approach allows us to focus our resources on delivering innovative features, security enhancements, and optimized performance in newer versions of diamOS, while ensuring that users on older versions continue to benefit from the underlying security and kernel updates provided by Ubuntu.

## Overlapping Releases and Support Cycles

Our release strategy involves launching a new major version of diamOS every year, meaning there may often be two diamOS releases built on the same Ubuntu LTS version. For instance, diamOS 2 and diamOS 3 are both expected to be built on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Although these versions will share a base, their individual support cycles from diam Systems will differ. Each version will receive its own 2-3 years of support, allowing our users to access new features and updates by transitioning to newer versions as they are released.

## What Happens When diamOS Support Ends?

When diam Systems ends support for a specific diamOS version, users will no longer receive updates to diam applications, system enhancements, or any custom diam technologies. However, they will continue to receive essential system and security updates for the underlying Ubuntu LTS release directly from Ubuntu until Canonical's support period concludes. In other words, the system base and kernel will remain secure and up-to-date even after our own support for the version ends, giving users the flexibility to remain on a familiar platform with extended support from Ubuntu.

## Ensuring a Smooth Transition to New Versions

To keep our users secure, productive, and on the cutting edge of technology, we encourage upgrading to the latest major version of diamOS as new releases become available. Our support strategy is designed to facilitate smooth transitions between versions, making it easier than ever to adopt new features and enhancements while maintaining system reliability.
